# Credit-Card-Recommendation

In this project, I combined customer data with credit card information using machine learning algorithms like KNN, Decision Trees, and Logistic Regression to offer personalized recommendations. Here's a quick overview of the process:

1) Alteryx: Leveraged for data blending, a crucial step where I combined Credit Card data and customer data. By merging these datasets using a common column, such as credit score, I created a unified dataset ready for analysis.

2) Pandas: Played a pivotal role in data preprocessing, allowing me to filter and select relevant columns from the blended dataset. Additionally, Pandas helped in encoding categorical variables into numerical values, a necessary step for machine learning model compatibility.

3) NumPy: Used for efficient numerical operations and data manipulation. NumPy's array functionality was particularly useful in handling and transforming the dataset.

4) Scikit-learn: A go-to library for machine learning tasks, Scikit-learn was instrumental in splitting the dataset into training and testing sets. I utilized its implementation of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Logistic Regression models for training. Scikit-learn also provided functions to evaluate the model accuracy, ensuring the reliability of the predictions.

5) LabelEncoder: A component of Scikit-learn, LabelEncoder was used to convert categorical variables into numerical values. This transformation is essential for machine learning algorithms to process the data effectively.

Excited to apply this project to real-world scenarios and assist customers in making informed decisions about their credit cards!
